        <p>The NYC Department of Sanitation <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/dsny/site/resources">provides</a>
            annual reports on the distribution of diverted recyclable and compostable materials. In these reports,
            average daily tons of recycling are reported along with the programs through which these donations take
            place. Some of the recycling and composting is facilitated directly through the DSNY (Department of
            Sanitation) and some is done through department-supported programs, individuals collecting, and through
            recycling drives hosted by organizations.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>Programs were introduced throughout the years that DSNY reported recycling totals. In FY 2014, the
            <a href="https://www.refashionnyc.org">Re-fashionNYC</a> textile donation and E-cycleNYC electronic waste donations program. Although DSNY already
            accepted textile and electronics recycling through various other methods and organizations, they partnered
            with nonprofits specifically for this. One of the programs that remained a mystery to me is the Hard Cover
            recycling program. I searched and searched and was unable to figure out what it could be. I think that
            further reporting and interviewing someone at the Department of Sanitation could provide to be helpful.

        <p>The DSNY (Department of Sanitation) collects both from the curbside and from containers. The curbside
            collections are 90% residential and 10% from institutions, according to a DSNY annual <a
                href="https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/dsny/site/resources/statistics/annual-dsny-non-dsny-collection">report.</a>
            Curbside
            recycling is collected once a week in bags or from cans set out in front of the curb. In <a
                href="https://dsny.cityofnewyork.us/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/about_dsny-non-dsny-collections-FY2013_0815.pdf">FY
                2013,</a> DSNY began a
            pilot program to collect organics curbside. 90% of containerized collections are from institutions and 10%
            from large residential buildings, according to DSNY. These collections happen at varying frequencies and
            from containers of varying sizes. It's much rarer for containers to be used for metal/glass/plastic
            recycling. Residents tend to recycle through curbside pick up instead of collecting recycling in a
            container, according to the same report.
