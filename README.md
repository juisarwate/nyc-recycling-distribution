# Recycling Distribution in NYC

My goal with this project was exploring a breakdown of different kinds of collections of recycling in NYC.

## Process

I manually collected the data from DSNY so that I could create an spreadsheet with a dictionary so I could both keep track of what each kind of recycling was but also so that I could observe trends as I collected it.

After this, I examined the breakdown of each type of recycling through the workbook I created and used what I found to create visualizations.

## Techniques

I used the following set of tools for my discovery:

 1. Excel
 2. Jupyter Notebooks/Pandas
 3. Datawrapper

I primarily worked using Excel workbooks before visualizing using Datawrapper.

## What I discovered

I discovered that the three most collected recyclables in average daily tons is DSNY-collected metal/glass/plastic recycling, DSNY-collected paper/cardboard recycling, and independentaly redeemed bottles and cans. The NY State Department of Environmental Conservation reports the collected number of containers of redeemed bottles and cans to DSNY as of FY12. These are cans and bottles that individuals can recycle at centers and collect small amounts of money for each item recycled.

## What I wish I could have achieved

I also wantws to map the different collection centers and which entities can recycle there, but I was unable to do this. Additionally, I wanted to reach a source at the DSNY and ask questions about the newer donation and recycling programs that developed over time. Also, I was totally unable to find out what 'Hard Cover Removals' are for which data reporting began FY16.
